<h1>The Best Movies according to Ed</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>

<hr/>

<p>I will preface this section of the website by saying that it is too difficult to complete: I cannot choose my 3 favuorite movies of all time. That might be because I have watched too many movies, might be that I am too indicisive, or it might be both (it probably is). So these are just 3 good movies that came to mind when writing this.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Now I know what you're thinking - that's three movies, is he done? Or is this a cop-out answer? Well, it's a cop-out answer. I will include the Hobbit films here too, just because I am a huge fan of this whole world.</p>

<h3>The Negotiator</h3>
<p>One of my all-time favourites. Classic Samuel L. Jackson being pissed off with the incompetent people he is surrounded by.</p>

<h3>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</h3>
<p>I love the art in all Studio Ghibli films and they all make me feel so comfortable and ahppy. But Laputa is my favourite. Enough said.</p>
